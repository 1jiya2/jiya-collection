  <br>   <b> "JIYA'S COLLECTION"</b> simply put,a fabric collection is a group of design that are created as a whole to intentionally work together 
  harmoniously. they are comprised  of various types of design (stripes,dots,large-scale and small-scae prints) and color palettes so that it is easier 
  to select fabrics that work well with one another. the work fabrics and cloth are used in textile assemly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking) as 
  synonyms for textile. however, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage. textile refers to any material made through weaing, knitting
  spearding, crocheting or bonding that may be used in prodction of furthur goods (garments etc).cloth may be used synonymusly with fabric but often refers to a 
  finished piece of fabric usesd for a specific purpose.
